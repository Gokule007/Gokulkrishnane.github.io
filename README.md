PROJECTS
   Vehicle direction detection
•	Identifying the direction of the vehicle is one of the important & diverse features in Autonomous driving & Advanced Driver Assistance Features. This particular sub-feature of identifying the direction of vehicle is basically identifying the direction the vehicle is taking based on the camera input.
  
   Adaptive Cruise Control
•	Adaptive Cruise Control Feature for passenger cars allows the host vehicle to adapt to the speed in line with the flow of traffic. Driving in heavy traffic or keeping a safe distance to the preceding vehicle calls for a high level of concentration. The Adaptive Cruise Control feature can reduce the stress on the driver by automatically controlling the vehicle speed & maintaining a predefined minimum distance to the preceding vehicle. As a consequence, the driver enjoys more comfort & can concentrate on the road little better.

   Highway Assistant-Lane Changing Assistant
•	 In monotonous highway driving situations, the Highway Assistant assists the driver by taking over longitudinal and lateral vehicle guidance. To a certain extent, the partially automated function can start, accelerate, brake, and steer the vehicle. The driver must constantly monitor the system and be prepared to take complete control of the vehicle at any time.
•	Drivers are taught to check their rearview and side mirrors, as well as look over each shoulder, before changing lanes. Even for those who adhere to this checklist, the vehicle's blind spot – the area alongside and just behind the vehicle – is a constant source of danger and is frequently the cause of serious accidents. Vehicles approaching quickly from behind can also be dangerous. This feature was created to make changing lanes safer.

   BATTERY-ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY
•	The Wabtec FLXdrive is the world's first 100% battery-electric, heavy-haul locomotive, designed to replace diesel locomotives in a hybrid configuration, offering zero-emission operation and reduced fuel consumption through regenerative braking and efficient energy management.
